# AgeGauge-Model

A linear regression model to predict age given certain health characteristics 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
=======
The goal of this project was to determine the age of a patient using common health information and ailments, i.e. smoking or diabetes. We were curious to see if certain health characteristics can determine a patient’s age, and if we know a few pieces of information about someone’s health, can we predict their age range. Taking these ideas further, our goal would be to decide what health factors have the greatest impact on our age and which factors could be fixed to have a patient's age accurately reflected by the model.

User Instructions:
==============
We are still in the beginning stages of this project. As we upload more code, we will update instructions on how to use this model. 

Techology Requirements:
=======================
This project was built using SAS code. You will need to have access to SAS 9.4 or SAS Studio to utilize this model. 

Project Owners:
====
This project was created by Samantha Doyle and Brianna Noel, graduate students at Kennesaw State University in the Data Science and Analytics program.
