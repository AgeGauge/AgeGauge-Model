# AgeGauge-Model

A linear regression model to predict age given certain health characteristics 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
=======
The goal of this project was to determine the age of a patient using common health information and ailments, i.e. smoking or diabetes. We were curious to see if certain health characteristics can determine a patient’s age, and if we know a few pieces of information about someone’s health, can we predict their age range. Taking these ideas further, our goal would be to decide what health factors have the greatest impact on our age and which factors could be fixed to have a patient's age accurately reflected by the model.

User Instructions:
==============
This code was built in SAS. 
To utilize the code, copy into a blank SAS program. Change the filepath for the proc import statement to the filepath of your dataset's location. The code will be ready to run.
To utilize the linear regression model, simply plug in values you have into the equation for the appropriate variables (see statistical report for equation and variable breakdown). The resulting output will be the biological age for the given information. 

Techology Requirements:
=======================
This project was built using SAS code. You will need to have access to SAS 9.4 or SAS Studio to utilize this model.
